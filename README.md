## Setting up the environment

**For VM management we'll need VirtualBox and Vagrant**.
I successfully tested the environment with versions 4.3.10 and 1.5.3 on MacOS X,
and with 4.3.12 and 1.6.3 on Ubuntu 13.10.
Please note that _there are unresolved issues_ when using older versions!

We will use a set of up to 4 virtual machines for the tutorial:
two will be used for load generation and two will be our system under test.

Let's setup the tutorial repository and the first MongooseIM
(system under test) VM:

    git clone git://github.com/lavrin/euc-2014.git euc-2014-tsung
    cd euc-2014-tsung
    git submodule update -i
    vagrant up mim-1  # this will take a few minutes

Hopefully, Vagrant finishes without errors.
Before setting up another MongooseIM VM, let's bring the first server node up:

    vagrant ssh mim-1
    sudo mongooseimctl start
    sudo mongooseimctl debug

An Erlang shell attached to the node should appear, with a prompt like:

    Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.0] [source-07b8f44] [64-bit] [smp:2:2]
      [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

    Eshell V6.0  (abort with ^G)
    (mongooseim@mim-1)1>

This means the installation went fine.
We can leave the shell with `control+c, control+c`.
Let's bring up another MongooseIM VM and verify that it automatically
joined the cluster:

    vagrant up mim-2  # this will take a few minutes
    vagrant ssh mim-2
    sudo mongooseimctl start
    sudo mongooseimctl mnesia running_db_nodes

Two nodes will most likely appear:

    ['mongooseim@mim-1','mongooseim@mim-2']

One more test we ought to do to ensure the service is running fine
on both VMs is checking whether it listens for XMPP connections:

    telnet mim-1 5222
    ^D

We should see something like:

    Trying 172.28.128.11...
    Connected to mim-1.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    <?xml version='1.0'?><stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'
      xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams' id='2096410314'
      from='localhost' version='1.0'><stream:error><xml-not-well-formed
      xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'/></stream:error>
      </stream:stream>
    Connection closed by foreign host.

We can do the same for the other node:

    telnet mim-2 5222

We also need to set up the Tsung nodes:

    vagrant up tsung-1 tsung-2

If the environment is fine, then let's stop some of the nodes for now:

    vagrant halt mim-2 tsung-2


## Basic test scenario

It's time we ran a basic Tsung test.
Let's ssh into a Mongoose node in one shell and set up some trivial
monitoring to see that the users actually get connected:

    vagrant ssh mim-1
    sudo mongooseimctl debug  # you server must be running for this to work

Now in the Erlang shell that appears:

    ejabberd_loglevel:set(4).
    q().

Again in Bash:

    tail -f /usr/local/lib/mongooseim/log/ejabberd.log

In a different shell window (try to have both of them on the screen at the
same time) let's ssh into a Tsung node and run a basic scenario:

    vagrant ssh tsung-1
    mkdir tsung-logs  # tsung will fail without this
    tsung -l tsung-logs -f tsung-scenarios/basic.xml start

You guessed right, `-l` tells Tsung to store logs into the given directory;
without it all your logs will go to `$HOME/.tsung/log`.

`-f` just tells Tsung what XML scenario to use.

Tsung will tell us that it's working with something similar to:

    Starting Tsung
    "Log directory is: /home/vagrant/tsung-logs/20140603-1520"

We should now get a log message for each established/torn down
connection in the console window where we have run `tail`:

    2014-06-03 15:39:45.707 [info] <0.535.0>@ejabberd_listener:accept:279
        (#Port<0.4574>) Accepted connection {{172,28,128,21},56051} ->
        {{172,28,128,11},5222}

    2014-06-03 15:39:47.809 [info] <0.867.0>@ejabberd_c2s:terminate:1610
        ({socket_state,gen_tcp,#Port<0.4574>,<0.866.0>}) Close session for
        user1@localhost/tsung

This tells us that Tsung has actually sent some data to MongooseIM.
How do we tell what this data was?
At the top of `tsung-scenarios/basic.xml` scenario we see:

    <tsung loglevel="debug" version="1.0" dumptraffic="true">

Thanks to `dumptraffic="true"` we'll find a dump of all the stanzas Tsung
exchanged with the server in `tsung-logs/20140603-1520/tsung.dump`.
It's convenient for verifying what exactly your scenario does or for debugging,
but **don't enable `dumptraffic` when actually load testing**
as it generates a huge amount of data.
The same goes for log level `debug`, which controls the amount of logging.

Inside the directory with the results of the test we'll also find
a number of log files:

    vagrant@tsung-1:~$ ls -1 tsung-logs/20140603-1539/*.log
    tsung-logs/20140603-1539/match.log
    tsung-logs/20140603-1539/tsung0@tsung-1.log
    tsung-logs/20140603-1539/tsung_controller@tsung-1.log
    tsung-logs/20140603-1539/tsung.log

`tsung.log` contains some statistics used to generate graphs after a test
run is finished.

`match.log` contains details about glob/regex matches (or match failures)
done on replies from the server.

`tsung_controller@<...>.log` will tell us which nodes had problems
starting when load generation distribution is enabled in the scenario,
while `<nodename>.log` files contain node specific logs, e.g. crash logs
explaining why some node hasn't responded to the controller.

Apart from all the logs and statistics of a test run the result
directory also contains a copy of the scenario Tsung was run with
(in our case `tsung-logs/20140603-1520/basic.xml`).


## Caveats and extra info

- Tsung is dumb, it doesn't understand XMPP
- 1024 open file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`);
  for more than 65k outgoing connections it's necessary to use multiple
  virtual interfaces
- Tsung controller is a single point of serialization -- severe delays
  and test failures when generating massive load
- log level debug and dump traffic to see actual XMPP stanzas
- scripts for making graphs
- the paths to ssh/Erlang/Tsung must match on all machines for distributed
  testing to work
- XMPP version 1.0 by default advertised by Tsung causes ejabberd/MongooseIM
  to refuse plain text authentication


## Troubleshooting

Vagrant might sometimes give you a "Connection timeout" error when trying
to bring a machine up or ssh to it:

    $ vagrant up tsung-1
    Bringing machine 'tsung-1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> tsung-1: Importing base box 'precise64_base'...
    ==> tsung-1: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
    ==> tsung-1: Setting the name of the VM: euc-2014_tsung-1_1401796905992_8586
    ==> tsung-1: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222. Now on port 2200.
    ==> tsung-1: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    ==> tsung-1: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...

        tsung-1: Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying...
        tsung-1: Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying...
        tsung-1: Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying...

The only way I found out to deal with this is to kill
the VirtualBox DHCP server:

    $ ps aux | grep -i vbox
    ...
    erszcz           10242   0.0  0.0  2447920   5872   ??  S     3:06PM
        0:00.07 /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxNetDHCP
        --ip-address 172.28.128.2 --lower-ip 172.28.128.3 --mac-address
        08:00:27:63:7D:35 --netmask 255.255.255.0
        --network HostInterfaceNetworking-vboxnet2 --trunk-name vboxnet2
        --trunk-type netadp --upper-ip 172.28.128.254
    $ kill 10242
